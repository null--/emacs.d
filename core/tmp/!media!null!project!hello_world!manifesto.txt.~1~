------- "In Pain" Manifesto -------

# THE WORLD:
the world is like a FARM and you the "MASON", want to be a shepherd, you have some DOGS to protect your FARMS, your HERD and your beloved SHEEP those
OBEDIENT peoples doing their best to make you richer DAY-TO-DAY, and to GUARANTEE the CONTINUANCE of this disgusting LOOP of life.
but we are like WOLVES. some us are interested in your sheep, some of us want the dogs, or shepherds.
some of us want to be part of a larger GROUP of wolves, and the others are hunting ALONE.
i'm an alone wolf want to eat THE shepherd ALIVE. i want to eat your red fresh flesh meat. 
i'm an ANONYMOUS HACKER, you may call me the "In Pain".

# THE HATES:
i hate of your CORPORATIONS, your COMPANIES, your AGENCIES, your BUREAUS and your MASONIC-LODGES.
i hate your EDUCATION system, your RELIGIONS, your ETHICS, your IMPERIALISM, your CAPITALISM, your SOCIALISM, and your GOVERNANCE. 
my mind is raped by your BOOKS, your NEWSPAPERS, your RADIO, your TV and your other bloody MEDIA.
i'm sick of your RULES, your COMMANDS, your OWNERSHIPS, your BANKING system and your ORDERS.
i'm sick your EXISTENCE.

# THE ONE:
i don't believe in Gods neither after-life, however i believe in ONE thing. one fundamental idea that defines my PURPOSE of fighting, and resisting against your rules. 
I believe that there is one man with a burning DESIRE to DEFEAT you, a man with enough POWER to stand between you and your new world. A man who want and can blind your ALL-SEEN-EYE, a man who can CHANGE this world...
it's my purpose to FIND him, to make him sure that we will fight BESIDE his shoulders to the DEATH. no matter how HARD, no matter how LONG, no matter how PAINFUL it is.
i BELIEVE that some day, he will RISE his flag, and makes the human race FREE.

# THE PAIN:
i was born to DISAPPOINT you, I know you afraid of me, you afraid of spreading my WORDS around the world like a virus, you afraid of MASSES and HIVE-MINDS.
you afraid of RESISTANCE and I promise, that soon you will afraid of your own shadow and your FRIGHTENED face on any mirrors.

# THE REVOLUTION:
it's not about me and you anymore, it's a about a world who are united to defend their freedom and humanity.
united as ONE, divided by ZERO.

# THE FUTURE:
I have no emotional ATTACHMENT to anyone.
This is why you cannot BUY me, cannot TRACE me, cannot OWN me, cannot CONTROL me and cannot CORRUPT me.
You have to KILL me, but you cannot BURY me, cause I'm an IDEA.
As long as you exist, the "In Pain" exists and the IDEA exists.

# THE MESSAGE:
I AM NOT GOING TO FORGET YOU, I AM NOT GOING TO FORGIVE YOU, EXPECT ME, YOU PATHETIC "Mason".
